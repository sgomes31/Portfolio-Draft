                <p>My name is Sofia Gomes and I'm an aspiring Art Director currently living in Atlanta, GA. I'm a proud Brazilian - so yes, I like soccer.</p>
                <p>Throughout my journey from Architecture school in Brazil to becoming an international student in the U.S., I have learned that there's no challenge I'm not willing to take on and that with passion and hard work, any dream is achievable.</p>
                <p>Advertising and design are in my mind and heart 100% of the time - that is, when I'm not looking at pictures of my golden retriever.</p>
                <p>What moves me is problem solving and expressing my creativity, and I hope to achieve my goals and aspirations trough them.</p>
