            <p> My intention was to create a piece that reflected my personality as a graphic designer and commemorated Brazil's rich artistic history.</p>
            <p> The zine is composed by a poem from celebrated Brazilian writer Fernando Pessoa, illustrated with hand made collages of pictures taken </p>
            <p> by award-winning Brazilian photographer Sebastião Salgado. Printing and craftsmanship were hand made by me, using a mix of vellum and </p>
            <p> pink cover paper (120 lb). </p>
